overviewText1 <- ("The prevalence of heart disease has been steadily increasing in recent years, and is
now a leading cause of death, accounting for approximately 30% of deaths globally according to the World Health Organization. 
While a range of presentations of heart disease have been identified, it is often 
caused from a blockage of arteries due to a build-up of cholesterol and other fatty acids. 
Medical research has focussed extensively on symptoms, predictors, and outcomes of heart disease, 
identifying genetic, physiological, gender, ethnicity or behavioural variables which lead to unique
outcomes in individual patients. These symptoms can arise from risk factors such as lack of exercise, poor
diet, tobacco, underlying congenital defects, chronic health problems such as diabetes or inherited from 
family members with histories of heart disease. Therefore, a large number of individuals throughout the 
general population are at risk of developing heart disease, and research into its causes,
treatments, and outcomes is of the utmost societal importance.")

overviewText2 <- ("The primary aim of this project is to use machine learning and other statistical
techniques and algorithms to develop a predictive model to predict if an individual has
coronary heart disease. This application aims to provide and educational tool for users to explore
this deadly disease, as well as offer the opportunity for an informal diagnosis using predictive algorithms.")
